## Description

Note: A Plain JavaScript variant of the this TypeScript/JSX example can be found [here](../injector-js).

Demonstrates the use of the `@injectable` and `@shared` decorators to register various classes for dependency injection. This uses the global default injector, but using a custom injector would work the same way, the decorators just need to be obtained from that injector instance.
